# Simplex Algorithm Debugging Report

## Test Problem
maximize 3x1 + 2x2
subject to:
  x1 + x2 <= 4
  2x1 + x2 <= 6
  x1, x2 >= 0

Expected optimal solution: x1 = 2, x2 = 2, Z = 10

## Expected Canonical Form Tableau

### Initial Tableau
```
Basis   x1   x2   s1   s2   RHS
  Z    -3   -2    0    0     0
 s1     1    1    1    0     4
 s2     2    1    0    1     6
```

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

#### Iteration 0 (Initial)
- Basic variables: s1 = 4, s2 = 6
- Non-basic variables: x1 = 0, x2 = 0
- Objective value: 0
- Optimality check: NO (x1 has coefficient -3, x2 has coefficient -2)
- Entering variable: x1 (most negative coefficient -3)

#### Iteration 1
- Ratio test for x1:
  - Row 1: 4/1 = 4
  - Row 2: 6/2 = 3 (minimum)
- Leaving variable: s2
- Pivot element: 2 (row 2, column x1)

After pivoting:
```
Basis   x1   x2   s1   s2   RHS
  Z     0  -0.5   0   1.5    9
 s1     0   0.5   1  -0.5    1
 x1     1   0.5   0   0.5    3
```

- Basic variables: s1 = 1, x1 = 3
- Non-basic variables: x2 = 0, s2 = 0
- Objective value: 9
- Optimality check: NO (x2 has coefficient -0.5)
- Entering variable: x2

#### Iteration 2
- Ratio test for x2:
  - Row 1: 1/0.5 = 2 (minimum)
  - Row 2: 3/0.5 = 6
- Leaving variable: s1
- Pivot element: 0.5 (row 1, column x2)

After pivoting:
```
Basis   x1   x2   s1   s2   RHS
  Z     0    0    1    1    10
 x2     0    1    2   -1     2
 x1     1    0   -1    1     2
```

- Basic variables: x2 = 2, x1 = 2
- Non-basic variables: s1 = 0, s2 = 0
- Objective value: 10
- Optimality check: YES (all coefficients >= 0)
- OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOUND

#### Final Solution
- x1 = 2
- x2 = 2
- s1 = 0 (slack)
- s2 = 0 (slack)
- Optimal value = 3(2) + 2(2) = 10

## Algorithm Issues to Check

### 1. Canonical Form Generation
- ? Objective row coefficients should be [-3, -2, 0, 0, 0]
- ? Constraint matrix should have identity for slack variables
- ? RHS values should be [0, 4, 6]

### 2. Optimality Check
- ? Should return FALSE when negative coefficients exist
- ? Should continue iterations until all coefficients >= 0

### 3. Entering Variable Selection
- ? Should select variable with most negative coefficient
- ? For initial: x1 (coefficient -3)

### 4. Ratio Test
- ? Should correctly identify minimum non-negative ratio
- ? Should handle zero and negative coefficients properly

### 5. Pivot Operations
- ? Should normalize pivot row
- ? Should eliminate other entries in pivot column
- ? Should update basic variable list

### 6. Objective Value Calculation
- ? Should calculate using original model coefficients
- ? Should update after each iteration
- ? Final value should be 10, not 0

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Initial Tableau Setup**
   - Verify coefficient signs in objective row
   - Verify constraint coefficients
   - Verify slack variable placement

2. **Trace First Iteration**
   - Verify optimality check returns false
   - Verify x1 is selected as entering variable
   - Verify s2 is selected as leaving variable
   - Verify pivot operation is performed correctly

3. **Verify Objective Value Calculation**
   - Check that it uses original coefficients (3, 2)
   - Check that it calculates: 3*x1 + 2*x2
   - Verify it's not using tableau RHS value

4. **Test Algorithm Termination**
   - Ensure it doesn't stop after first iteration
   - Ensure it continues until truly optimal
   - Verify final solution values

## Expected vs Actual Results

### Expected Final Result
```
Status: Optimal
Algorithm: Primal Simplex
Optimal Objective Value: 10.000
Optimal Solution:
  x1 = 2.000
  x2 = 2.000
  s1 = 0.000
  s2 = 0.000
```

### Current Actual Result
```
Status: Optimal
Algorithm: Revised Primal Simplex
Optimal Objective Value: 0.000
Optimal Solution:
  s1 = 4.000
  s2 = 6.000
  x1 = 0.000
  x2 = 0.000
```

The current result shows the initial basic feasible solution, not the optimal solution. This indicates the algorithm is terminating prematurely on the first iteration.
