# Revised Simplex Product Form and Price Out Implementation

## Overview

I have modified the Revised Primal Simplex algorithm to display **Product Form** and **Price Out** iterations instead of full tableaux, as requested. This provides a more authentic representation of how the Revised Simplex method actually works.

## Changes Made

### ? **1. Modified RevisedSimplexSolver.cs**

#### **PerformRevisedSimplexIterations Method**
Completely replaced the iteration display to show:

#### **Product Form Phase:**
- **Current Basis Display**: Shows which variables are currently basic
- **Basic Solution Values**: Displays x_B values for each basic variable
- **Basis Matrix Operations**: Shows the matrix operations performed

#### **Price Out Phase:**
- **Reduced Costs Calculation**: Shows c?_j for all non-basic variables
- **Optimality Testing**: Checks if all reduced costs are non-negative
- **Entering Variable Selection**: Identifies the most negative reduced cost

### ? **2. Added Supporting Classes**

#### **IterationStep Class** (in Models/SimplexIteration.cs):
```csharp
public class IterationStep
{
    public int StepNumber { get; set; }
    public string StepType { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public List<StepValue> Values { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

#### **StepValue Class** (in Models/SimplexIteration.cs):
```csharp
public class StepValue
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Value { get; set; }
    public string Notes { get; set; }
}
```

### ? **3. Enhanced Iteration Details Display**

#### **Modified ShowIterationDetails Method**:
- **Detects Revised Simplex**: Automatically detects when showing Revised Simplex iterations
- **Product Form Display**: Shows detailed matrix operations and basis updates
- **Price Out Display**: Shows reduced cost calculations and optimality tests
- **Fallback to Tableau**: Still shows tableaux for regular Primal Simplex

## Sample Output Format

### **Revised Simplex Iteration Display:**

```
=== REVISED SIMPLEX ITERATION 0 ===

CURRENT BASIS:
  x_B[1] = s1 = 4.000
  x_B[2] = s2 = 6.000

CURRENT OBJECTIVE VALUE: 0.000

PRICE OUT PHASE:
Calculating reduced costs for non-basic variables...

REDUCED COSTS:
  c?_x1 = -3.000
  c?_x2 = -2.000

OPTIMALITY TEST: FAILED
Most negative reduced cost: c?_x1 = -3.000
ENTERING VARIABLE: x1

PRODUCT FORM PHASE:
Computing pivot column for entering variable x1...

PIVOT COLUMN (B?¹A_j):
  y_1 = 1.000  (constraint 1, basic var: s1)
  y_2 = 2.000  (constraint 2, basic var: s2)

RATIO TEST:
  s1: 4.000 / 1.000 = 4.000
  s2: 6.000 / 2.000 = 3.000 ? MINIMUM
LEAVING VARIABLE: s2

BASIS UPDATE:
Old Basis: [s1, s2]
New Basis: [s1, x1]

ITERATION COMPLETE
Next iteration will start with new basis
```

## Algorithm Phases Explained

### **1. Price Out Phase**
- **Purpose**: Determine which non-basic variable should enter the basis
- **Process**: 
  - Calculate reduced costs: c?_j = c_j - c_B^T B^(-1) A_j
  - Check optimality: If all c?_j ? 0, then optimal
  - Select entering variable: Choose j with most negative c?_j

### **2. Product Form Phase** 
- **Purpose**: Determine which basic variable should leave the basis
- **Process**:
  - Compute pivot column: y = B^(-1) A_j for entering variable j
  - Check unboundedness: If all y_i ? 0, then unbounded
  - Perform ratio test: min{x_B[i]/y_i : y_i > 0}
  - Update basis: Replace leaving variable with entering variable

### **3. Matrix Updates**
- **Purpose**: Update the constraint matrix and RHS for next iteration
- **Process**:
  - Perform pivot operations on A matrix
  - Update RHS vector b
  - Maintain basis inverse implicitly

## Key Benefits

### ? **Educational Value**
- Shows the **true revised simplex process** with matrix operations
- Demonstrates **basis management** and **reduced cost calculations**
- **Separates the two main phases** of revised simplex clearly

### ? **Professional Presentation**
- **Clean, structured output** showing each calculation step
- **Mathematical notation** (c?_j, B^(-1), etc.) for authenticity
- **Logical flow** from price out ? product form ? basis update

### ? **Algorithmic Accuracy**
- **Faithful to revised simplex theory** and textbook presentations
- **Shows matrix operations** instead of full tableau manipulations
- **Maintains numerical precision** while showing intermediate steps

## User Experience

### **For Revised Primal Simplex:**
1. **Load model** and select "Revised Primal Simplex"
2. **Solve problem** - iterations show Product Form and Price Out phases
3. **Double-click iterations** to see detailed matrix operations
4. **View step-by-step** basis updates and reduced cost calculations

### **For Regular Primal Simplex:**
1. **Unchanged behavior** - still shows full tableaux
2. **Same double-click details** with pivot operations
3. **Consistent interface** between both algorithms

## Technical Implementation

### **Algorithm Detection**
The system automatically detects which algorithm is being used:
- **Revised Simplex**: Shows Product Form and Price Out
- **Regular Simplex**: Shows traditional tableaux

### **Data Storage**
All calculations are stored in the `SimplexIteration.Steps` collection:
- **Step details** preserved for later analysis
- **Values tracked** for debugging and verification
- **Timestamps** for performance monitoring

### **Display Logic**
The `ShowIterationDetails` method:
- **Checks algorithm type** by examining iteration steps
- **Formats output appropriately** for each algorithm
- **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing code

## Compliance with Requirements

? **"Display the Canonical Form"** - Initial tableau still shown in Canonical Form tab
? **"solve using the Revised Primal Simplex Algorithm"** - Algorithm properly implemented
? **"Display all Product Form and Price Out iterations"** - Each iteration shows both phases
? **"instead of those tables"** - No more full tableaux for Revised Simplex

The implementation now properly displays the **mathematical essence** of the Revised Simplex method through its **Product Form** and **Price Out** phases, providing an **authentic and educational** representation of this important optimization algorithm.
